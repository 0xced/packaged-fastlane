Installing bundled ruby + fastlane:

Download the .zip file, and double click on the install executable (or run it from a terminal) and follow the on screen instructions.

This will move the ruby + fastlane bundle into `~/.fastlane` in addition to adding that directory to your `$PATH` variable.

To get started using fastlane, either open a new shell, or `source` your configuration file (e.g. `~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.).
